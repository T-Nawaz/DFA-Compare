# DFA Compare
A simple command line app to check if any given input string is valid for the given DFA table.

# Usage
There are two .txt files named dfaTable.txt and input.txt and the names are pretty self explanatory.

In the second file, provide the input string, starting state and ending state.

There is already some testing data in the files. Please follow the format used in the files to get proper results.
